# Coffee-website ☕🍪🍩🍫

Developed a React-based coffee shop website that allows users to browse a variety of coffee products, add items to their cart, and view their selections on a dedicated cart page. The project includes essential features such as dynamic product listings, a responsive shopping cart, and smooth user interactions. Additionally, various enhancements were implemented to improve overall functionality and user experience. This project showcases my ability to create efficient and interactive e-commerce platforms using React and modern web development practices.
